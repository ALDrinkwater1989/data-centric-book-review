# Data Centric project

## Introduction

Welcome to my data centric project page.
This site was created with the idea in mind of someone who might be new to a gaming community, or someone who does not understand the jargon that is used when people play games. It is designed as a community driven page where people are able to add, delete and modify terms that are commonly used within gaming communities, which in turn can be searched for to see a definition of the term, to allow a bettter understanding.
